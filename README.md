# KMeansColor
Extract image color summary using kmeans

## Demo
Open the notebook file. The code should already be run on the TJHSST Rubik's Cube club logo.

To run the code on a different image, simply edit the image file path variable and rerun the entire notebook. Be aware that large images will take longer to process.
